            <p>Innovating the future, today!</p>
            <p> Our startup provides a cutting-edge solution for real-time traffic light adjustment using 
                AI and machine learning to optimize traffic flow in cities. 
                By analyzing live traffic data, our system dynamically adjusts signal timings to reduce congestion, improve commute times, and minimize emissions. This not only enhances road safety but also contributes to a more sustainable urban environment. Our goal is to make smart city infrastructure more efficient and responsive to real-world traffic conditions.</p>

            <h2>Technical Description</h2>
            <p>Our core technology utilizes advanced algorithms, sensors, and real-time data processing to improve urban traffic systems. Basically, we implement cameras into traffic lights. Using that cameras and computer vision algoritms, we collect data, analyse it and give real-time adjustment to the traffic lights. Our data model use different weights for different types of cars and prioritization. Below are some key technical components of our solution:</p>

                    <h3>AI-Powered Traffic Light Management</h3>
                    <p>Object Detection: using YOLOv8 model to detect the vehicles from cameras.
                        Vehicle Classification: classifying detected cars into categories (cars, buses, emergency vehicles etc.) with fine-tuning the model with photos of vehicles in the particular city.</p>
